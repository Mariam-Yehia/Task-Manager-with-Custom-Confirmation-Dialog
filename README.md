# Task-Manager-with-Custom-Confirmation-Dialog
A simple and responsive task manager built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to add, edit, mark as completed, and delete tasks. It also features a custom-designed confirmation dialog for task deletion. All tasks are stored in localStorage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.
